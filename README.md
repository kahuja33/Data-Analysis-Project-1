# Data-Analysis-Project-1
This project is about making ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) and Data Analysis project using Python and MySQL
We started with calling a API for a Order Details dataset from Kaggle. After extraacting the data to Python, we did data processing in order to prepare data for running our Explorartory Data Analysis. Once the data is processed, we loaded the Data to MySQL Server and did the Analysis on MySQL.

All the parts of the project are integrated to Jupyter*both Python and MySQL), hence we have only one .ipynb file
