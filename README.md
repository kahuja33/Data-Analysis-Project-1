# Data-Analysis-Project-1
This project is about making ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) and Data Analysis project using Python and MySQL

We started with calling a API for a Order Details dataset from Kaggle. After extraacting the data to Python, we did data processing in order to prepare data for running our Explorartory Data Analysis. Once the data is processed, we loaded the Data to MySQL Server and did the Analysis on MySQL.

All the parts of the project are integrated to Jupyter*both Python and MySQL), hence we have only one .ipynb file.

Talking about the ata, we used an Order details dataset(around 10,000 records), which is the data about the sold products across different geographies, their order price and profits against the various products along with the order details from an e-commerce website.
